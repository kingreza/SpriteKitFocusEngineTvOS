This example uses [UIFocusEnvironment](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppleTV_PG/WorkingwiththeAppleTVRemote.html) to set focus on SKNode items in a scene based on the input received from a Siri remote.

This example also uses SpriteKit's [SKWarpGeometryGrid](https://developer.apple.com/reference/spritekit/skwarpgeometrygrid) to simulate a "lean" as user lightly move in either directions on a Siri remote.
